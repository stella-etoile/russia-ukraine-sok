\section{Project Preparation and Prerequisites}\label{sec:prep}

As our work is a summary of existing knowledge on censorship in the Russo--Ukrainian War since 2022, we do not require any technical infrastructure or specialized tooling to complete the project. Our SoK relies on systematically collecting, reviewing, and synthesizing prior scholarship rather than generating new measurements or datasets.

Our preparation consists of assembling a comprehensive and reasonably scoped corpus of sources, including technical studies, legal analyses, and socio-political examinations of information control during the conflict. We then organize these insights into an accessible and coherent entry point for understanding internet censorship as it has evolved throughout the ongoing war.
