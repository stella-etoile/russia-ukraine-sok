\section{Ethics}\label{sec:ethics}

Our work does not introduce new data collection, experimentation, or interaction with human subjects. As a synthesis of publicly available research, it carries no direct ethical risks. We aim to present prior findings impartially and accurately within the constraints of our six-page format, acknowledging differing perspectives while avoiding normative judgments about state actions or policy decisions.
