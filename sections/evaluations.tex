\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

Our evaluation focuses on the breadth and balance of coverage across the full timeline of the conflict. A fair SoK must avoid overrepresenting one side of the conflict or restricting its analysis to a narrow period of events. Accordingly, we assess our work by ensuring that censorship practices, disruptions, and information-control strategies from both Russia and Ukraine are represented and contextualized.

We also evaluate completeness by examining whether our synthesis captures major incidents and trends from the beginning of the full-scale invasion through the present. This approach allows us to provide a comprehensive overview rather than a partial or time-limited snapshot of wartime information controls.
