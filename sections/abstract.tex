Since the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, and especially with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia and Ukraine have been implicated in a significant increase in online censorship and attacks on internet infrastructure. We noticed two different types of research papers covering censorship in the Russo-Ukrainian War: the first observes the attacks that occurred immediately after the beginning of the full-scale war, while the second type focuses on current attacks. We are interested in providing a synthesis of censorship attacks that have occurred over the past four years, as the Russo-Ukrainian War is one of the most contemporary incidents of information warfare, and it provides insight on how such events play out in the current internet ecosystem. With this information, people are able to better prepare themselves against these forms of internet censorship and conduct further research into the topic.
